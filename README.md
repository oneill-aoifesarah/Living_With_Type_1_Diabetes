## Color Scheme, Typography, Iconography

The colors utilised throughout are easily recogniable as the official color of diabetes campaigns (blue). This ensures that the user can easily relate to the purpose of the website upon inital review. To ensure the website remains welcoming, peaceful, and retains engamenet of the user, i utilised a pastel color scheme to ensure a calming environment for visitors to the site, complementing the pastel blues with a combination of light pinks and yellows so that the color scheme and appealability of the website was mainated. Text color complemented and added dimmension to the background color formats, with variations of white, ivory, blue, and pastel purples utilised throughout

Typography utilised were soft formated text styles including Nunito-sans and Poppins. this ensured the format of text retained the desired impact when compiled with relevant color schemes.

Iconography, obtained from favicon, aligned images to the key text contained within relevant sections. This included an image of a cutlery set (corresponding with information on nutrition); a droplet image (corresponding with blood glucose testing and monitoring information); and an image of a dumbbell (corresponding with exercise information).
