            <h3>Diabetes Management <i class="fa-solid fa-droplet" style="color: #1c4e65;"></i></h3>
            <p>Type 1 diabetes is a chronic [life-long] autoimmune disease that prevents your pancreas from making insulin.</p>
            <p>Daily injections of insulin are needed to keep your blood glucose levels under control.</p>
            <p>Checking your blood glucose is quick and easy. This can be done by using a blood glucose monitor</p>
            <p>Guidelines suggest that you check your blood glucose regulalry, including the beginning and end of your day. The ideal bloog glucose levels are between 5 to 9 mmol.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Healthy Eating <i class="fa-solid fa-utensils" style="color: #1c4e65;"></i></h3>
            <p>Knowing how many carbohydrates you're eating and drinking helps you manage your blood glucose levels by matching your fast
            acting insulin dose to the amount of carbs in your meals and snacks.</p>
            <p>Carbohydrates include startchy foods; dairy; sugar; fruits; and honey</p>
            <p>Keeping a food diary is useful in learning to track your carbohydrates can be benficial to ensuring you're eating well and avoiding spikes in your blood glucose levels.</p>
            <p>Many vegetables, such as carrots, peas, brocoll, and spinach, have a low glycmemic index. This means they have a low carbohydrate count and have minimum impact on blood glucose levels.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Exercise <i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell" style="color: #1c4e65;"></i></h3>
            <p>Regular exercise can help you manage your weight, improve your mood, and contribute to better sleep.</p>
            <p>However, strenuous activity can cause your blood sugar to drop and lead to low blood sugar, which is called hypoglycemia.</p>
            <p>Intense bouts of exercise can also cause your blood sugar to rise. If it rises above normal levels, its known as
            hyperglycemia</p>
            <p>It's important to check your blood sugar before and after periods of exercise. It's also useful to keep a snack close to hand in the event you experience a drop in your blood sugars.</p>
